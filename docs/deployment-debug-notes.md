# Deployment Debug Notes (2026-03-12)

## What's Done

### Domain & Email
- **Domain**: `ptnkalum.com` purchased on Cloudflare Registrar
- **Resend**: domain verified, API key working
- **DNS**: 4 records added (DKIM, SPF MX, SPF TXT, DMARC) — all verified
- **Supabase SMTP**: configured with Resend (`smtp.resend.com`, port 465, username `resend`)
- Emails ARE being sent and received (confirmation emails arrive)

### Supabase Production
- **Project**: `vrgobrbrjvoojgvzortm` (Singapore region)
- **All 31 migrations** pushed successfully
- **Auth SMTP** configured with Resend
- **Email confirmation** enabled
- **Site URL**: `https://ptnkalum.com`
- **Redirect URLs**: `https://ptnkalum.com/**`, `https://ptnkalum.com/auth/callback`

### Vercel
- **Deployed** from GitHub `sonha2409/alumni-network` (main branch)
- **Function region**: Singapore (sin1) — co-located with Supabase
- **Domains**: `ptnkalum.com` (primary), `www.ptnkalum.com`
- **Auto-deploy** from main branch working

### Environment Variables (Vercel)
All set in Vercel dashboard. See Vercel project settings for values.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (https://ptnkalum.com)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (AlumNet <noreply@ptnkalum.com>)

### Code Changes Made
1. `supabase/migrations/*` — replaced `uuid_generate_v4()` with `gen_random_uuid()` (commit `cf0b0fa`)
2. `src/app/(auth)/actions.ts` — detect missing session on signup (email confirmation pending), show "check your email" message (commit `64d7d57`)
3. `src/app/(auth)/actions.ts` — pass `emailRedirectTo` in signup for PKCE flow (commit `6fe9721`)
4. `src/proxy.ts` — sign out before redirect in fail-closed paths to prevent redirect loops (commit `01e9008`)
5. `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — support both PKCE code exchange and token_hash verification (commit `de3277b`)
6. `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — added error logging (commit `22775cf`)
7. `src/proxy.ts` — handle PKCE code exchange directly in proxy (commit `718c08f`)
8. `src/proxy.ts` — redirect to `/login?email_confirmed=true` when PKCE exchange fails (graceful fallback)
9. `src/app/(auth)/login/login-form.tsx` — show "Email confirmed!" banner when `email_confirmed=true` param present
10. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — wrap LoginForm in Suspense for useSearchParams()

### Supabase Email Template (Confirm sign up)
Current template:
```html
<h2>Welcome to AlumNet!</h2>

<p>Thanks for signing up. Please confirm your email address to get started:</p>

<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Confirm my email</a></p>

<p>If you didn't create an account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
```

## The Bug: Email Confirmation Redirect

### What works
- Signup creates user in `auth.users` and `public.users`
- Confirmation email IS sent and received
- Clicking the confirmation link DOES confirm the email (user can log in afterward)
- Manual login after confirmation works — user gets to dashboard/onboarding

### What doesn't work
- After clicking the confirmation email link, user lands on `/login` instead of `/onboarding`
- No session is created during the redirect — user must manually log in

### What we observed
1. **Confirmation link URL flow**: User clicks email link → Supabase verifies token → redirects to app with `?code=...&next=%2Fonboarding`
2. **But the path is `/login`**, not `/auth/callback` — e.g., `ptnkalum.com/login?code=55692e2f-...&next=%2Fonboarding`
3. **Vercel runtime logs show NO request to `/auth/callback`** — the request goes directly to `/login`
4. The proxy code exchange (commit `718c08f`) should catch the `code` param on any route, but it's still not working

### What we tried (and didn't fix it)
1. **Custom email template with `{{ .TokenHash }}`** — token_hash starts with `pkce_`, can't be verified with `verifyOtp()`
2. **`{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`** — Supabase's default flow, but redirects to site root/login instead of /auth/callback
3. **`emailRedirectTo` in signup action** — set to `${siteUrl}/auth/callback?next=/onboarding`, Supabase seems to ignore it or redirect URL isn't in allowlist
4. **www vs non-www alignment** — tried both `ptnkalum.com` and `www.ptnkalum.com` as primary. Currently `ptnkalum.com` is primary
5. **Code exchange in proxy** — added code to intercept `code` param on any route. Still lands on `/login`
6. **Redirect URLs in Supabase** — added `https://ptnkalum.com/**` and `https://ptnkalum.com/auth/callback`

### Likely root cause theories
1. **PKCE code_verifier mismatch**: The code_verifier cookie is set during signup on the browser. When user clicks email link, they may be in a different tab/context where the cookie isn't available. Without the code_verifier, `exchangeCodeForSession()` fails silently.
2. **Supabase ignoring `emailRedirectTo`**: The redirect URL might not match the allowlist exactly (query params, trailing slashes, www vs non-www).
3. **Proxy code exchange failing but not logging**: The code exchange in the proxy might be failing, and the `console.error` might not be visible in Vercel logs due to timing or log level.

### Fix applied (2026-03-13): Graceful fallback for failed PKCE exchange

**Root cause confirmed**: PKCE `code_verifier` cookie is set during `signUp()` in the user's browser. When the user clicks the confirmation email link, they often open it in a different browser tab/context where the cookie isn't available. The PKCE code exchange fails because it can't find the matching `code_verifier`. However, Supabase already confirmed the email server-side before redirecting — so the email IS confirmed, only the session creation fails.

**Changes made**:
1. `src/proxy.ts` — when PKCE code exchange fails, redirect to `/login?email_confirmed=true` (strips stale `code` param, signals success)
2. `src/app/(auth)/login/login-form.tsx` — detect `email_confirmed=true` in URL, show green success banner: "Email confirmed! Please sign in to continue."
3. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — wrap `LoginForm` in `<Suspense>` (required by Next.js for `useSearchParams()`)

**Expected behavior after fix**:
- User signs up → receives confirmation email → clicks link → email is confirmed by Supabase → PKCE exchange fails → proxy redirects to `/login?email_confirmed=true` → user sees "Email confirmed! Please sign in to continue." → user logs in → reaches onboarding/dashboard

**Status**: RESOLVED (2026-03-13). The initial proxy redirect fix didn't work because
the proxy was also missing cookie forwarding on the success path. A second fix copied
`supabaseResponse` cookies onto the redirect response. The auth callback route handler
was also rewritten to use manual cookie management (same pattern as proxy) for robustness.

Additionally, the password reset email template in Supabase needed to use `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
(not a custom URL with `{{ .TokenHash }}`). After fixing the template, the reset flow works
but lands on `/reset-password` which is a 404 — tracked as Feature #36a in SPEC.md.

**If this fix doesn't work** (verify by testing the full signup flow on production):
- Check Vercel runtime logs for `[Proxy] Code exchange failed` — if this log doesn't appear, the proxy isn't intercepting the request at all (check matcher config)
- If the user still lands on `/login` without the `email_confirmed` param, the proxy redirect isn't firing — the code exchange might be throwing an unhandled error instead of returning an error object
- Remaining options if this approach fails:
  1. **Try disabling PKCE**: In Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email → check if there's a PKCE toggle
  2. **Client-side fallback**: On the `/login` page, detect `code` param and attempt `exchangeCodeForSession` client-side (would need the code_verifier cookie though, so likely same issue)
  3. **Nuclear option**: Disable email confirmation for soft launch, enable later when properly tested
